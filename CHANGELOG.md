# Changelog

All notable changes to fallow are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Unused import binding detection via `oxc_semantic`: imports where the bound name is never read in the importing file no longer count as references to the exported symbol, improving unused-export detection precision
- Namespace destructuring detection: `const { foo, bar } = ns` after `import * as ns` (and dynamic import / require namespaces) now correctly tracks accessed members for narrowing

### Fixed
- Namespace imports with whole-object consumption patterns (`Object.values(ns)`, `{...ns}`, `for..in ns`, `const { a, ...rest } = ns`) now correctly mark all exports as referenced instead of being skipped by the entry-point guard

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Markdown output format (`--format markdown`)
- Oxc-inspired code quality: workspace-level clippy configuration with `all`, `pedantic`, `nursery`, `cargo` lint groups and 13 restriction lints
- `#[expect]` over `#[allow]` for all clippy suppressions (warns when suppression becomes unnecessary)
- Const size assertions on hot-path types (`ModuleNode`, `ModuleInfo`, `ExportInfo`, `ImportInfo`, `Edge`) to prevent accidental struct bloat
- VS Code extension icon and marketplace metadata

### Changed
- Module graph split into focused submodules (`types.rs`, `build.rs`, `reachability.rs`, `re_exports.rs`, `cycles.rs`)
- Dev profile optimized with `debug = false` and selective `opt-level` for proc-macro crates

### Fixed
- Windows build: restrict `ModuleNode` size assertion to Unix (`PathBuf` layout differs on Windows MSVC)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- CI failures across typos, cargo-deny, docs, MSRV, and clippy
- Windows symlink support for workspace integration test

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- npm publish: switch to OIDC trusted publishing (no NPM_TOKEN secret needed)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- npm publish: add registry authentication to release workflow

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Windows build: restrict `DiscoveredFile` size assertion to unix (different `PathBuf` layout on Windows MSVC)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- TypeScript project references: workspace discovery from `tsconfig.json` `references` field (additive with npm/pnpm workspaces, deduplicated by canonical path)
- Elementary cycle enumeration for circular dependencies (individual cycles within SCCs, max 20 per SCC, deterministic output)
- CSS Modules support (`.module.css`/`.module.scss`) with class name export tracking
- `fallow migrate` command to convert knip and jscpd configs
- CSS/SCSS file discovery with `@import`, `@use`, `@forward`, and `@apply` extraction
- Cross-workspace `exports` field subpath resolution with output→source fallback
- Pnpm content-addressable store detection for injected dependencies
- Cache-aware incremental parsing with `--performance` cache hit/miss stats
- Code Lens with export reference counts and click-to-navigate in LSP
- Duplication diagnostics and "Extract duplicate into function" code action in LSP
- VS Code extension CI, LSP binary builds, and marketplace publishing
- Nuxt `resolve_config()` for deep config parsing (modules, css, plugins, extends, postcss, path aliases)
- Circular dependency benchmarks vs madge and dpdm
- Inline suppression for circular dependencies (`fallow-ignore-file circular-dependency`)
- Backwards compatibility policy (`docs/backwards-compatibility.md`)
- JSON output schema documentation (`docs/output-schema.json`)

### Fixed
- UTF-8 boundary handling in duplication detection (multi-byte character safety)
- Exports map resolution robustness for cross-workspace imports
- Nested output subdirectory mapping (e.g., `dist/esm/utils.mjs` → `src/utils.ts`)
- Trace path matching for monorepo compatibility (canonicalized vs user-provided paths)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Production mode (`--production`) — excludes test/dev files, limits to production scripts, reports type-only imports
- Clone families with refactoring suggestions (extract function/module)
- Config schema generation (`fallow config-schema`) with `$schema` support for IDE autocomplete
- Duplication baselines (`--save-baseline` / `--baseline`) for incremental CI adoption
- Deep `resolve_config()` for all top 10 framework plugins (ESLint, Vite, Jest, Storybook, Tailwind, Webpack, TypeScript, Babel, Rollup, PostCSS)
- JSONC as default config format (with JSON and TOML still supported)
- Pre-commit hooks for fmt and clippy checks

### Changed
- Migrated repository to fallow-rs organization

### Fixed
- Detection accuracy: star re-export tracking, workspace plugins, JSX fallback
- GitHub Action YAML parse error and benchmark workflow

### Performance
- Optimized resolve, discovery, and duplication detection hotpaths

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Code duplication detection (`fallow dupes`) with suffix array + LCP algorithm
- 4 detection modes: strict, mild, weak, semantic
- Duplication benchmarks comparing fallow dupes vs jscpd (4-75x faster)
- Plugin system with 40 built-in framework plugins as single source of truth
- Dynamic import resolution (template literals, `import.meta.glob`, `require.context`)
- Vue/Svelte SFC parsing with `<script>` block extraction
- Dynamic member heuristics (Object.values/keys/entries, for..in, spread)
- GitHub Action with job summaries, PR comments, and `--sarif-file` flag
- LSP diagnostics for all 10 issue types

### Fixed
- CJS require analysis and namespace narrowing for detection accuracy

### Performance
- Clone detection pipeline optimized up to 177x faster vs initial implementation

- CI regression tracking benchmarks

### Fixed
- Reduced false positives based on knip comparison across 31 projects
