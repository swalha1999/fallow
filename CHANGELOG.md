# Changelog

All notable changes to fallow are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `fallow health` command: per-function cyclomatic complexity (McCabe classic) and cognitive complexity (SonarSource algorithm) analysis with configurable thresholds (default: cyclomatic 20, cognitive 15), `--top N`, `--sort`, `--changed-since`, and human/JSON/compact output formats
- `[health]` config section with `maxCyclomatic`, `maxCognitive`, and `ignore` glob patterns
- `check_health` MCP tool for AI agent integration
- Function name capture from class methods, object method shorthand, variable declarators, property definitions, and `export default function()`

### Changed
- Duplicate export locations now include line and column numbers (JSON output `schema_version` bumped to 2)
- GitHub Action job summary redesigned with tables, icons, and collapsible sections
- Cache version bumped to 15 (old caches auto-invalidate)

### Fixed
- SARIF URIs now percent-encode brackets for Next.js dynamic routes (`[slug]` → `%5Bslug%5D`)
- JSON output uses relative paths for readable CI summaries
- GHAS availability check before SARIF upload in GitHub Action

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Class instance member tracking: `const svc = new MyService(); svc.greet()` correctly tracks `greet` as a used class member, reducing false positives for class-based code (NestJS services, Angular components, etc.)
- JSDoc `@public` tag support: exports annotated with `/** @public */` (or `/** @api public */`) are never reported as unused, designed for library authors whose exports are consumed by external projects
- Type-only dependencies rule: production dependencies only imported via `import type` are reported as `type-only-dependency` (they should be devDependencies since types are erased at runtime)
- Progress spinners showing analysis pipeline stages (discovery, parsing, resolution, analysis) for better UX on larger projects
- VS Code extension published on Open VSX for Cursor and VSCodium support
- Historical performance metric tracking with GitHub Pages dashboard
- Package.json `#subpath` imports integration test

### Changed
- VS Code extension bundler migrated from esbuild to Rolldown
- Large modules split into focused submodules for maintainability: `discover.rs`, `config.rs`, `resolve.rs`, `detect.rs`, `cache.rs`, `visitor.rs`, `check.rs`, and integration tests
- Watch mode now shows changed file paths and clears screen between runs

### Fixed
- SARIF output now includes `tool.driver.version` and `$schema` fields
- Conformance workflow JSON output handling

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- `dupes --changed-since`: duplication detection now supports `--changed-since` to only report clone groups involving changed files
- Angular plugin `resolve_config()`: parses `angular.json` to extract `styles`, `scripts`, `main`, `browser`, and `polyfills` from build targets as entry points; adds Angular peer dependencies (`rxjs`, `@angular/common`, `@angular/platform-browser`, `@angular/build`) to tooling deps; widens entry patterns for Nx monorepo layouts
- Nx plugin `resolve_config()`: parses `project.json` to extract executor references as dependencies and `options.main` as entry points; adds `@nx/angular`, `@nx/storybook`, `@nx/webpack`, and other `@nx/*` packages to tooling deps
- JSON config file filesystem fallback: plugins with JSON config patterns (e.g., `angular.json`, `**/project.json`) are now discovered via filesystem scan when they're not in the JS/TS discovered file set; workspace-level plugins also check the project root for config files
- File-based plugin activation for ESLint and Vitest: plugins now activate when their config files exist in a workspace, not just when the package is in `dependencies`. Fixes false positives in monorepos where `eslint`/`vitest` are only in the root `package.json`
- Vitest plugin marks `setupTests.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` and `test-setup.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` as always-used when active, fixing false positives for test setup files referenced via imported/spread base configs
- Nested package entry discovery now searches `services/`, `tools/`, and `utils/` directories in addition to `packages/`, `apps/`, `libs/`, `modules/`, `plugins/`
- Infrastructure entry point detection: Dockerfiles, Procfiles, and `fly.toml` are scanned for source file references

### Fixed
- Bare specifier cache poisoning: the resolver cache for bare specifiers (e.g., `@scope/pkg`) now only caches results from successful `oxc_resolver` resolution; previously, when resolution failed for a tsconfig path alias that looked like an npm package, the `NpmPackage` fallback was cached and prevented correct resolution for all subsequent files
- Production dependency false positives: `plugin_tooling` dependencies (e.g., `zone.js`, `@angular/compiler`) are now excluded from unused production dependency detection, matching the existing dev dependency behavior
- Workspace entry pattern double-prefixing: entry patterns from `resolve_config()` that are already project-root-relative (e.g., `apps/client/src/styles.css` from `angular.json`) are no longer double-prefixed with the workspace path
- `check --changed-since` now filters all issue types: unlisted dependencies, duplicate exports, and circular dependencies were previously unfiltered
- Duplication stats recomputation: `recompute_stats` now deduplicates overlapping line ranges per file (matching the original `compute_stats` logic), fixing inflated `duplicated_lines` counts after baseline or `--changed-since` filtering
- Plugin entry point attribution: entry points discovered by plugins now show the correct plugin name (e.g., `Plugin { name: "nextjs" }`) instead of the generic `Plugin { name: "plugin" }`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Unused optionalDependencies detection: packages in `optionalDependencies` never imported or used as script binaries are now reported
- Function overload deduplication: multiple overload signatures for the same function name are deduplicated to avoid false positive unused-export reports

### Changed
- Workspace discovery performance: canonicalize optimization reduces syscall overhead during workspace resolution
- Re-export chain performance: `matches_str` optimization for faster re-export chain propagation

### Fixed
- Ecosystem test script: `--root` flag and install commands corrected for cross-project validation

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Unused import binding detection via `oxc_semantic`: imports where the bound name is never read in the importing file no longer count as references to the exported symbol, improving unused-export detection precision
- Namespace destructuring detection: `const { foo, bar } = ns` after `import * as ns` (and dynamic import / require namespaces) now correctly tracks accessed members for narrowing

### Fixed
- Namespace imports with whole-object consumption patterns (`Object.values(ns)`, `{...ns}`, `for..in ns`, `const { a, ...rest } = ns`) now correctly mark all exports as referenced instead of being skipped by the entry-point guard

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Markdown output format (`--format markdown`)
- Oxc-inspired code quality: workspace-level clippy configuration with `all`, `pedantic`, `nursery`, `cargo` lint groups and 13 restriction lints
- `#[expect]` over `#[allow]` for all clippy suppressions (warns when suppression becomes unnecessary)
- Const size assertions on hot-path types (`ModuleNode`, `ModuleInfo`, `ExportInfo`, `ImportInfo`, `Edge`) to prevent accidental struct bloat
- VS Code extension icon and marketplace metadata

### Changed
- Module graph split into focused submodules (`types.rs`, `build.rs`, `reachability.rs`, `re_exports.rs`, `cycles.rs`)
- Dev profile optimized with `debug = false` and selective `opt-level` for proc-macro crates

### Fixed
- Windows build: restrict `ModuleNode` size assertion to Unix (`PathBuf` layout differs on Windows MSVC)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- CI failures across typos, cargo-deny, docs, MSRV, and clippy
- Windows symlink support for workspace integration test

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- npm publish: add registry authentication to release workflow

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Windows build: restrict `DiscoveredFile` size assertion to unix (different `PathBuf` layout on Windows MSVC)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- TypeScript project references: workspace discovery from `tsconfig.json` `references` field (additive with npm/pnpm workspaces, deduplicated by canonical path)

- Code Lens with export reference counts and click-to-navigate in LSP
- Duplication diagnostics and "Extract duplicate into function" code action in LSP
- VS Code extension CI, LSP binary builds, and marketplace publishing
- Nuxt `resolve_config()` for deep config parsing (modules, css, plugins, extends, postcss, path aliases)
- Circular dependency benchmarks vs madge and dpdm
- Inline suppression for circular dependencies (`fallow-ignore-file circular-dependency`)
- Backwards compatibility policy (`docs/backwards-compatibility.md`)
- JSON output schema documentation (`docs/output-schema.json`)

### Fixed
- UTF-8 boundary handling in duplication detection (multi-byte character safety)
- Exports map resolution robustness for cross-workspace imports
- Nested output subdirectory mapping (e.g., `dist/esm/utils.mjs` → `src/utils.ts`)
- Trace path matching for monorepo compatibility (canonicalized vs user-provided paths)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Clone families with refactoring suggestions (extract function/module)
- Config schema generation (`fallow config-schema`) with `$schema` support for IDE autocomplete
- Duplication baselines (`--save-baseline` / `--baseline`) for incremental CI adoption
